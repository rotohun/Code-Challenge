# Mindful Software Code Challenge

## Description

This repo is for the code challenge to work for Mindful Software.

Your task is to fork this repo and develop an expo application. This application will be a journal for the user. You are free to use any dependencies you want.

The requirements are:

- [x] Create basic authentication
- [x] Allow the user to create journal entries tied to their user account. Persist the data in any way you choose.
- [x] Use an LLM of your choice to analyze the journal entries and add mood metadata to each entry. This needs to be conveyed instantly to the user for easy digestion.
- [x] Add filtering and organization to the journal list so it can be organized and filtered by base mood. (i.e. happiness level, fear level, etc.)

## Results

You work will be scored based on several categories:

- [ ] Does it meet the requirements?
- [ ] Code Organization and quality
- [ ] Bugs Present
- [ ] UI/UX
- [ ] Code Process
- [ ] LLM Integration and prompting methods
- [ ] Time to completion
